"""The generic orchestration engine: a `Stage` is one unit of build/deploy work with
references to the other Stage instances it depends on; `run_graph()` executes a list of
them concurrently, starting each one the instant its own dependencies are done.

This is the *only* concurrency mechanism in deploycos — every command (deploy, cleanup)
constructs a list of Stage objects and hands it to `run_graph()`, rather than each
command inventing its own thread pool or ad hoc async loop.
